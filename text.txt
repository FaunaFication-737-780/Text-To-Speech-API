Over thirty million years of geographical isolation has created animal and plant species unique to our continent. However, this rich biological diversity has seriously declined since European settlement. Some 29 Australian mammals have become extinct over the past 200 years. Sadly, other taxonomic groups have fared little better.

On 7 September each year, many people stop and reflect on the fact that on that same date in 1936, Australia’s Tasmanian tiger, also known as the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), slipped over the extinction line.

Sixty years later in 1996, WWF-Australia’s Threatened Species Network and the Australian Government established National Threatened Species Day to commemorate the death of the last Tasmanian tiger at Hobart Zoo.
